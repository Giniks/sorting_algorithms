Project Title: C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Overview

In this project, we will review different concept of sorting alogrithm and implementation through worst, average and best case scenario. We search and merge through linear or binary method, complexity( time and space), and runtime(Big O notation).

Project Description

Bubble Sort Alogrithm: This works by repeatedly comparinf adjacent elements in a list and swapping them if they are out of order. The alogrithm gets its name from the way that smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the alogrithm iterates. This makes bubble sort easy to understand and implement, but it's not the most efficient sorting alogrithm.
