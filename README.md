Project Title: C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Overview

In this project, we will review different concept of sorting alogrithm and implementation through worst, average and best case scenario. We search and merge through linear or binary method, complexity( time and space), and runtime(Big O notation).

Project Description

Bubble Sort Alogrithm: This works by repeatedly comparinf adjacent elements in a list and swapping them if they are out of order. The alogrithm gets its name from the way that smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the alogrithm iterates. This makes bubble sort easy to understand and implement, but it's not the most efficient sorting alogrithm.


Insertion Sort Alogrithm for Doubly linked List.

In this sort, the alogrithm considers each element in the unsorted part of the list, one at a time. For each element, it compares it to the element that come before it in the sorted part of the list. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, it stays in place.

Otherwise, it is swapped with the previous element
